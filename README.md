# SettingsPreferences
Settings Preferences with Fragments

You will extend the Android Settings Example App  to have -

-----------------------

<- Settings  - 

       General

       Notification

       Data & Sync

       Sound

-----------------------

These respective headers will launch corresponding sub-menus.

You will need to use PreferenceFragment.

Note that 'Sound' is from System Settings -> Sound menu; so you need to pull it in in your app.
